    recovery_codes: Backup recovery codes
    recovery_codes_regenerated: Recovery codes successfully regenerated
    recovery_instructions_html: If you ever lose access to your phone, you can use one of the recovery codes below to regain access to your account. <strong>Keep the recovery codes safe</strong>. For example, you may print them and store them with other important documents.
    setup: Start up
    wrong_code: You put in an invalid auth string. Is your clock working?
  user_mailer:
    welcome:
      edit_profile_action: Setup profile
      edit_profile_step: You can customize your profile by uploading an avatar, header, changing your display name and more. If you’d like to review new followers before they’re allowed to follow you, you can lock your account.
      explanation: Here are some tips to get you started
      final_action: Start posting

      full_handle: Your full alias
      full_handle_hint: This is what you would tell your friends so they can message or follow you from another instance.
      review_preferences_action: Change preferences
      review_preferences_step: Make sure to set your preferences, such as which emails you'd like to receive, or what privacy level you’d like your posts to default to. If you don’t have motion sickness, you could choose to enable GIF autoplay.
      subject: Welcome to Mastodon
      tip_bridge_html: If you are coming from Twitter, you can find your friends on Mastodon by using the <a href="%{bridge_url}">bridge app</a>. It only works if they also used the bridge app though!
      tip_federated_timeline: The federated timeline is a firehose view of the Mastodon network. But it only includes people your neighbours are subscribed to, so it's not complete.
      tip_following: You follow your server's admin(s) by default. To find more interesting people, check the local and federated timelines.
      tip_local_timeline: The local timeline is a firehose view of people on %{instance}. These are your immediate neighbours!
      tip_mobile_webapp: If your mobile browser offers you to add Mastodon to your homescreen, you can receive push notifications. It acts like a native app in many ways!
